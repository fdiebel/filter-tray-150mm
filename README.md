150mm Filter Tray Adapters
=============

Filter tray adapters to allow use of common-sized filters in the non-standard 150mm filter trays on Konvas and Kinor cameras. They are designed to hold Tiffen glass filters, which are generally up to ~4mm in thickness.

As is usual with Soviet-era camera gear, not every filter tray is manufactured in the same way; these adapters fit perfect in some of my filter trays, and are loose/tight in others. You may need to tweak the source to fit your specific unit.

Instructions
--------

I printed with PLA filament on the following settings, and results were great.

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 1.05
* Fill: 20

Print two of these for each filter tray, as shown in <https://github.com/fdiebel/filter-tray-150mm/blob/master/img/03.jpg>
